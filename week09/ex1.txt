Hit ratio of the three algorithms
- Random Algorithm: Hit ratio is 0.055 
- NFU Algorithm: Hit ratio is 0.044 
- Aging Algorithm: Hit ratio is 0.046


The random page replacement algorithm seems to be the least efficient at reducing page faults, while the NFU and aging algorithms have similar hit ratios, with the NFU algorithm performing 
slightly better with the specific test provided. These hit ratios also suggest that there is a relatively high rate of page faults, and there may be room for improvement in 
the page replacement strategy to further reduce page faults and improve system performance.
