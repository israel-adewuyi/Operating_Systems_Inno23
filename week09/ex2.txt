The second test with a miss ratio of 1 suggests that the TLB was inadequate for the workload, while the first test with a miss ratio of 0.81 indicates 
that the TLB was more effective due to its larger size, resulting in fewer TLB misses and fewer page table lookups. This indicates there might be a correlation
between the size of the TLB and the number of pages.
