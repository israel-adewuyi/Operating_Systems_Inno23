-------------------- DIFFERENCES --------------------
1. File System Structure:
	Changed Root: The output only shows the contents of the lofsdisk directory. It includes ex1, file1 and file2 (created within the chroot environment), and standard directories like bin and lib.
	Unchanged Root: The output shows the entire file system hierarchy, starting from the root (/). It includes standard directories such as etc, bin, lib, usr, etc.
2. Missing Standard System Directories:
	Changed Root: Standard system directories like /etc, /usr, /var, etc., are not present. The focus is on the contents of the lofsdisk directory.
	Unchanged Root: Full system directory structure is visible, including essential directories like /etc, /usr, /var, etc.
