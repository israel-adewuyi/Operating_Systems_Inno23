After each fork() call, a new child process is created, for each running process. Initially, it was only the parent process running. I observed that after each fork call, a new child process is created from all the existing processes. 

The results of each iteration for both n's are summarised below. 

N = 3
After iteration 1 - 2 processes
After iteration 2 - 4 processes
After iteration 3 - 8 processes

N = 5
After iteration 1 - 2  processes
After iteration 2 - 4  processes
After iteration 3 - 8  processes
After iteration 4 - 16 processes
After iteration 5 - 32 processes


For each i from 1 to N, after the ith iteration, there are 2^i processes in the end.
