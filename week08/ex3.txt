- Ideally, we should expect "si" and "so" values to be minimal as the system has sufficient free RAM to accommodate the program's memory allocation (10 MB every second), and this is what I observed. 
- The si and so fields remained at 0, which means that there wasn't enough memory pressure to require swapping in and out of the disk. 

- But the memory usage increases by approximately 10 MB in each iteration, till it reaches the 10th iteration.

- As expected in the vmstat output, the "free" field also decreases with each iteration as memory is gradually allocated in each iteration.
