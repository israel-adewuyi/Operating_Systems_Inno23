Three consecutive runs produced these outputs. It is observed that the first 
fit allocation algorithm performs faster than the Worst fit or Best fit. This is because
in the first fit allocation algorithm, it allocates the adrs to the first "valid" 
contiguous memory segment it finds and doesn't bother about optimizing the allocation. 

There is almost negligible difference between the Worst fit and the Best fir allocation
algorithm.
