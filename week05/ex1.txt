The main reason for creating n named pipes for n subscribers is to isolate communication 
between the publisher and each subscriber. Each named pipe allows messages to flow 
between the publisher and a specific subscriber. 

It also allows for parallel message delivery between the publisher and a number of subscribers, all at once.
