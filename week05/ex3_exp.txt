In ex3, we split the problem of counting prime numbers in the range [0, n) among m threads. 

Each thread computes the result for an interval of length n / m, and we combine the results from them after each thread completes. 

From the execution times in ex3.txt we can see that the more threads we have, the less REAL time it takes to compute the count of prime numbers.
